Purpose
-------

PicoMusic is a tool for learning about Python and music,
by composing music with Python.


Design goals
------------

-   Simple: to help you learn about programming and music composition.

-   Pythonic: transfer what you learn to non-musical projects.

-   Expressive: enough to create compelling audiovisual masterpieces.

-   Finished projects can be exported and shared.

-   Runs comfortably on macOS, Windows, and Linux (including Raspbian on Raspberry Pi 3).
